# Personal-Website
This is the skelton build to my first personal website. 

It has functional pages that will highlight projects I have completed and a resume, as well as some other information about me seperate from coding.

I will fill in the outline with more information and styling as my skills and accomplishments progress. 

It also has a basic javascript element which I hope to make more elaborate.

Thanks for checking it out.
